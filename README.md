# Surf_ScrapeV2
Surf_ScrapteV2 is a program that scrapes the web(magic seaweed) for data on the surf for a specified surf spot(wave height, sea/air temperature, tides).
Once this data is obtained, it is formated into a string, which is sent via sms to your phone.
Intended to be run with cron(Unix OS) so the program is run at a specified time daily(I run mine at 8am everyday)
